                Hey there ! <br>
                We are Or & Daniel, two 4th year students at the Technion â€“ Israel <br>
                Institute of Technology, and we wanted to tell you a little bit about <br>
                ourselves and why we choose to develop this game. <br>
                First thing you need to know about us is that we're both very <br>
                loving and dedicated aunts to our amazing young nieces and nephews. <br>
                Over time, while helping our nieces and nephews with their homework, <br>
                we saw a need for a learning tool that help young kids practice and <br>
                improve their basic mathematical skills, that matches itself <br>
                to the kids' changing knowledge level and skills over time. <br>
                So in order to help our young nieces and nephews and <br>
                all the other little kids who struggle  with their math, <br>
                we decided to build this game in order to give them a fun <br>
                and interactive way to practice and improve those <br>
                important skills.
